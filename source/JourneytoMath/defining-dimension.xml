      <title>Defining Dimension</title>

      <p>
        We have already looked at fractals and found some interesting things about them. 
        One of the more interesting fact is that fractals have non-integer dimensions! That seems very unintuitive.

      <p>
      Fractals unusual nature makes us wonder what "dimension" exactly is.

      Linear algebra is also very concerned with the notion of dimension. In linear algebra, we visit unfamiliar worlds of math.
      We concern ourselves with all sorts of questions in these alien environmen with questions like "What is zero here?".  
      We often wonder how big these worlds are. These "worlds" are technically called "vector spaces", and the size of these worlds 
      is how we define dimension.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      We typically express the characters in these worlds as matrices. In particular, a <m> m \times n</m> matrix is 
      considered to be a $mn$-dimensional object m (where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns).

        <statement>
        <p>
          Identify the dimension of the following matrices.
        
          <md> \left[\begin{array}{cc}
                -1 \amp 2 \\
                1 \amp 3
