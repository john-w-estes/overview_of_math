    <title>Applications of Calculus</title>

    <p>
        You probably have heard of calculus, but it's common to not know what calculus 
        is about. Calculus may be the best answer to the question ``When will I ever need math?" 
        In his book "Infinite Powers", mathematician Steven Strogatz argues that calculus is the 
        greatest human discovery. How can that be? Why is calculus 
        deemed to be so important?

    <p>
        Calculus is the field of mathematics that harnesses the power of infinity. Through it, 
        we can model movement, change, and a huge amount of other important applications in 
        chemistry, biology, computer science, business, physics, engineering, and so much more.

        <title>Finding Applications of Calculus</title>
        <statement>
        <p>
            With a group, search online for places where calculus is used in 
            application or has led to development in some field. Try to find six applications.

        <p>
            While groups are sharing what they discovered, list a few applications that you
             did not have written from the previous exercise.
