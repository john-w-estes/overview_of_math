    <title>Archimedes' Great Idea</title>

    <p>
        Modern Calculus was formulated by Sir Isaac Newton and Gotfriend Leibniz in 1687.
         But the great mathematician, Archimedes, was really close to developing Calculus 
         in 300 B.C. (Almost 2000 years before Newton and Leibniz!) with the formation of 
         the limit: the starting point of well-defined calculus (though he never used the 
         word "limit" in his construction.).

        <title>What is this weird number?</title>

    <p>
            To illustrate how Archimedes was thinking in terms of calculus, we should think 
            about circles. Ancient cultures were puzzled that every circle carried an unusual 
            trait with it. That is, if the circle had diameter <m>d</m>, then it would take 
            length <m>3d</m> plus a tiny bit more to wrap around the circumference.
    </p>

    <p>
        This fact was true with every circle, and each culture attempted to calculate the number 
        that was the ratio of circumference to diameter. No one in the ancient world estimated 
        it as well as Archimedes did.
    </p>

    <p>
        So what is this number? We define <m>\pi</m> as <m>\pi = \frac{c}{d}</m> for the circle 
        with circumference <m>c</m> and diameter <m>d</m>. Computers can now calculate <m>\pi</m>
         to millions of digits, but <m>\pi</m> eluded the greatest of minds for centuries.
    </p>

    <p>
        For reference, here are the first 30 digits of <m>\pi</m>.

    <me>
        \pi \approx 3.14159265358979323846264338327

        <statement>
        <p>
            With a group, search online for places where calculus is used in 
            application or has led to development in some field. Try to find six applications.
