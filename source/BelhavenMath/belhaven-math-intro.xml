       <title> Introduction to Belhaven Mathematics </title>
       <p>
        Welcome to the Mathematics and Computer Science Department (MCS) at Belhaven University. We work hard to provide unique
        learning opportunities, to do a lot of math, and to have fun while grow. Maybe we can best summarize what Belhaven MCS
        is about with the three crucial pillars of our identity:
        <ul>
          <li>
            community, 
          </li>
          <li>academic experiences,  </li>
          <li> techonology. </li>
        </ul>
        We look at each of these pillars in Units I, II, and III respectively.
        Expect to jump around from chapter to chapter as we will want to discuss these departmental pillars throughout the semester.
        And, in general, we hope you will embrace these pillars as we believe they lead to successful studies and successful careers.
      </p>

      <p>We will take time this semester to look at all of these this semester, and we encourage all of our students to take it to heart. 
      In fact, we want all of our students to memorize the Mathematics and Computer Science Mission Statement.
      </p>

        I pursue my career and calling through the pillars of community, academic experiences, and technology.

      <p> Young students often underestimate the power of good communication. The quicker you get comfortable with
      communicating with peers, professors, and advisors the better. In addition to email, most courses in the MCS
       utilize Microsoft Teams, a professional, team-building messaging app. The quickest and easiest way to support
       the Community pillar of the MCS Mission Statement is to simply download Teams, join our course's team (listed in the syllabus), 
       join the BelhavenSTEM team, and turn on notifications in both!
