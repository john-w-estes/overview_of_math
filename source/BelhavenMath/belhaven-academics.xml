        <title>MCS Academic Experiences</title>

        <p>Your degree is measured in credit hours. You're taking classes ultimately to earn a degree. 
        You'll also expect some grades in those classes. BUT let's be careful not to mistake grades and
        credit hours with actual learning. Our goal in the MCS Department is provide an environment of
        true learning. We want you to adapt a mentality of a continual learning: one who learns inside
        and outside of the classroom.
        </p>

        <p>
        In addition to core classes such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, 
        and Differential Equations, Belhaven's MCS department delivers a number curriculum add-ons. 
        Let's take a look at what additional academic experiences we offer.
        </p>

        <subsection> 
            <title>Major's Field Test</title>
        
        <p>Every Belhaven math major takes the standardized Major's Field Test their senior year. 
        The exam is conducted nationally and covers everything from Calculus to Linear Algebra to
         Algebra and Number Theory. In order to prepare for the MFT Exam, students take MFT Quizzes 
         in key classes and review these quizzes in MAT 492.</p>
        
        </subsection>

        <subsection> 
            <title>Mathematical Research</title>
        
        <p>In MAT 391, 392, 491 and 492, students participate in the mathematical research process 
        reviewing recent results of a select topic and attempting to further it. These students will
         present their findings as a poster and presentation at the Belhaven University Undergraduate 
         Research Symposium (BUURS) and our sectional meetings of the MAA.</p>        
        </subsection>

        <subsection> 
            <title>The Eyes of Faith Portfolio</title>
        
        <p>What does the Bible say about mathematics? What does life as a Christian mathematician entail? 
        What role does change and randomness play in God's creation? These are deep questions that we will 
        ask ourselves during throughout our mathematics coursework at Belhaven.
        </p>

        <p> The book <term>Mathematics through the Eyes of Faith</term> by Russell Howell and James Bradley 
        approaches these questions in an intellectually honest manner <xref ref="biblio-eyes"/>. Students will 
        use this text as a reference to write their own thoughts in their <term>Eyes of Faith Portfolio</term>,
        a collaboration of Eyes of Faith papers written over several courses covering chapter of our reference text.
        </p>

        <p> The chapter breakdown follows curiously close to our major requirements and 
        is summarized in the following table. (You might want to hang on to this one.)

            <title>For Engineering Majors</title>
        
        <p> In addition to academic experiences math majors experience, students in Belhaven's engineering partnership 
          <ui>
            <li>learn AutoCAD in PHY 119 Intro to Engineering</li>
            <li>interact with professional engineers from places like Yates construction, Raytheon, and Asset Engineering.</li>
            <li>take site visits to Ole Miss, Mississippi State, and places like Nissan and the U.S.
             Army Corps of Engineers Research and Development Center (ERDC).</li>
          </ui>
        </p>        
      </subsection>

      <subsection> 
            <title>For Actuarial Science Majors</title>
        
        <p>For those majoring in Actuarial Sciences (ASM), students will
          <ui>
            <li>learn statistical software such as R,</li>
            <li> sit for the first actuarial exam, the Probability Exam (SOA Exam P).</li>
          </ui>
        </p>        
      </subsection>

      <subsection> 
            <title>Seminars</title>
        
        <p> Several times a year, we bring in speakers to present topics not typically covered in a standard course. 
        Attending these talks is a fantastic way to meet professionals who are doing what you hope to do one day and reinforces
        our pillars of community and academic experiences. 
        </p>
        <p> Just a few examples: 
          <ui>
            <li>professors from other universities sharing their research</li>
            <li>professional actuaries looking for interns</li>
            <li>scientists from NASA, the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and the US Corps of Engineers</li>
            <li>industry professionals in the fields of engineerng and computer science.</li>
          </ui>
        </p>
