      <title>HW: Mathematical Careers</title>
      
      <p>
        What can you do with your degree? 
        What doors does a background in mathematics open? Even though we are intersted in mathematics like an artist cares for art,
        you will probably want to get a job at some point. We will now take some time to research careers related to mathematics degrees.
        Use the HW: Mathematical Careers worksheet found on Canvas.
