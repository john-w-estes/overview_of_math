      <subsection>
        <title>Build a Resume</title>
        <p>Go ahead and write a resume. You won't have much to put on a resume yet,
         but you will as time goes on. Write your resume now, and you update it each semester. 
         If you need help getting started, our Student Care center is a great place to get
         started.</p>

      <subsection>
        <title>Take Additional Courses</title>
        <p>We recommend that every student either selects a double major or a minor (speaking of resume).
         A few academic choices we feel are good ones include: 
         <ui>
            <li>Computer Science</li>
            <li>Chemistry</li>
            <li>Art, Music, Dance, or Theatre</li>
            <li>Biblical Studies</li>
            <li>Graphic Design</li>
            <li>Web Design (minor)</li>
         </ui>
         Oh yeah... don't forget to join the Maker Campus.
