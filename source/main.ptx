      <title>Our Goals</title>

      <p>
        Welcome to Overview of Mathematics, a quick look at what you can expect from your studies as a mathematics student.
        In particular, we hope to show
        <ol>
          <li>
            the culture of the Mathematics and Computer Science Department (MCS) at Belhaven, 
            along with the broader community of mathematicians and shared culture,
          </li>
          <li>various interesting topics of mathematics that we can explore with very little
            background experiences,  </li>
          <li> and interesting technology that pairs well with mathematical studies. </li>
        </ol> 
        And we hope to have some fun while doing it. Best practices for this course are just showing up with a good attitude and
        having a curiosity about math topics.
      </p>

       <title> Introduction to Belhaven Mathematics </title>
       <p>
        Welcome to the Mathematics and Computer Science Department (MCS) at Belhaven University. We work hard to provide unique
        learning opportunities, to do a lot of math, and to have fun while grow. Maybe we can best summarize what Belhaven MCS
        is about with the three crucial pillars of our identity:
        <ul>
          <li>
            community, 
          </li>
          <li>academic experiences,  </li>
          <li> techonology. </li>
        </ul>
        We look at each of these pillars in Units I, II, and III respectively.
        Expect to jump around from chapter to chapter as we will want to discuss these departmental pillars throughout the semester.
        And, in general, we hope you will embrace these pillars as we believe they lead to successful studies and successful careers.
      </p>

      <p>We will take time this semester to look at all of these this semester, and we encourage all of our students to take it to heart. 
      In fact, we want all of our students to memorize the Mathematics and Computer Science Mission Statement.
      </p>

      <remark>
        <title>Belhaven MCS Mission Statement</title>
        I pursue my career and calling through the pillars of community, academic experiences, and technology.
      </remark>

      <p> Young students often underestimate the power of good communication. The quicker you get comfortable with
      communicating with peers, professors, and advisors the better. In addition to email, most courses in the MCS
       utilize Microsoft Teams, a professional, team-building messaging app. The quickest and easiest way to support
       the Community pillar of the MCS Mission Statement is to simply download Teams, join our course's team (listed in the syllabus), 
       join the BelhavenSTEM team, and turn on notifications in both!

      <title>How to Be a Successful Math Student</title>
      <p>
        What makes someone a good math student? Being smart? Not always... Being a hard worker? Work ethic defintiely helps! 
        How do you study? How do you learn? Before going too far towards your degree in mathematics, maybe we should think about
        good strategies to be successful. Let's take a little time to think about how to be a successful student.
      </p>

      <question xml:id="past-experiences">
        <title>Past Math Experiences</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Think about your past experiences in mathematics courses. When were you most successful? 
          What practices helped you be successful?
        </p>
       </statement>
       </question>

       <p>
        Now let's start thinking about others.

       <question xml:id="other-studentss">
        <title>Qualities of Math Students</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Think about someone that you know that is good at mathematics. List five qualities that makes this person good at math.
        </p>

        <p>
          What kind of actions can we take to develop these qualities?
        </p>
       </statement>
       <solution>
        <p>
          Answers will vary, but a desire to understand will motivate development of these qualities.
